#### ALL RIGHTS RESERVE 2020

This website is build and maintained solely by Mikko Caguiat.
Some of the parts of this website are compiled from various tutorials and pre made templates
that i edited to fit the design of my website.

Files, websites and software used.
1. [Github](https://github.com/) - documenting everything that I accomplish in my website.
2. [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) - this serves as my web hosting platform as I develop my website. Sooner when it is done. I will publish it in a separate domain name and upgrade to a bigger web hosting platform. For now, netlify suites the best for developing beginner websites like this.
3. [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) for monitoring people who visits my site.
4. [Bootsrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) as my main CSS source.
5. [Lokesh Dhakar's Light Box](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/) script for loading smoothly my images. 
6. [Unplash](https://unsplash.com/) - special mention to unplash and the contributors for my copies of great electronics photos. Soon I'll be incorporating my own photos but for now i'll be using photos from them. Copyright to the owners. I am planning to put a carousel to the bottom to all the sources i copied.
