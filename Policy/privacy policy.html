            <h1>MGC Tech Tips Privacy Policy</h1>
            <hr>
            <h2>Privacy policy</h2>
            <p>This privacy policy (&quot;Policy&quot;) describes how Website Operator (&quot;Website Operator&quot;,
                &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;) collects, protects and uses the personally
                identifiable information (&quot;Personal Information&quot;) you (&quot;User&quot;, &quot;you&quot; or
                &quot;your&quot;) may provide on the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow"
                    href="https://mgctechtips.netlify.app">mgctechtips.netlify.app</a> website and any of its products
                or services (collectively, &quot;Website&quot; or &quot;Services&quot;).</p>
            <p>It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you
                can access and update this information. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we
                do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.</p>
            <h3>Automatic collection of information</h3>
            <p>Our top priority is customer data security and, as such, we exercise the no logs policy. We process only
                minimal user data, only as much as it is absolutely necessary to maintain the Website or Services.
                Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish
                statistical information regarding Website usage. This statistical information is not otherwise
                aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.</p>
            <h3>Collection of personal information</h3>
            <p>You can visit the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone
                could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the
                Website's features, you will be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name
                and e-mail address). We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you publish
                content, or fill any online forms on the Website. You can choose not to provide us with your Personal
                Information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Website's features. Users who
                are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.</p>
            <h3>Storing personal information</h3>
            <p>We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal
                obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required
                or permitted by law. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal
                Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once
                the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the
                right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after
                the expiration of the retention period.</p>
            <h3>Use and processing of collected information</h3>
            <p>In order to make our Website and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we need to
                collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we
                may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Some of the information we
                collect is directly from you via our Website. However, we may also collect Personal Information about
                you from other sources. Any of the information we collect from you may be used to help us run and
                operate our Website and Services.</p>
            <p>
                Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with our Website, where you are located
                in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) You have given your consent for one or more
                specific purposes. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is
                subject to European data protection law; (ii) Provision of information is necessary for the performance
                of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) Processing is
                necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) Processing is related to
                a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us;
                (v) Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third
                party.</p>
            <p> Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such
                processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases
                below. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing,
                and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual
                requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>
            <h3>The rights of users</h3>
            <p>You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us. In particular, you have the
                right to do the following: (i) you have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given
                your consent to the processing of your information; (ii) you have the right to object to the processing
                of your information if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii) you have
                the right to learn if information is being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects
                of the processing and obtain a copy of the information undergoing processing; (iv) you have the right to
                verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be updated or corrected; (v) you have the
                right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of your information, in which case, we
                will not process your information for any purpose other than storing it; (vi) you have the right, under
                certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us; (vii) you have the
                right to receive your information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if
                technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. This provision
                is applicable provided that your information is processed by automated means and that the processing is
                based on your consent, on a contract which you are part of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.
            </p>
            <h3>Privacy of children</h3>
            <p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you are under
                the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Information through our Website or Service. We
                encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce
                this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through our Website or
                Service without their permission.</p>
            <p>If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us
                through our Website or Service, please contact us. You must also be old enough to consent to the
                processing of your Personal Information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or
                guardian to do so on your behalf).</p>
            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>The Website uses &quot;cookies&quot; to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file
                that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver
                viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in
                the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
            <p>We may use cookies to collect, store, and track information for statistical purposes to operate our
                Website and Services. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically
                accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you
                choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the features of the Website and
                Services. To learn more about cookies and how to manage them, visit <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.internetcookies.org">internetcookies.org</a></p>
            <h3>Do Not Track signals</h3>
            <p>Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want
                to have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in
                connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable
                information from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as they move across different
                websites over time. Our Website does not track its visitors over time and across third party websites.
                However, some third party sites may keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content,
                which enables them to tailor what they present to you.</p>
            <h3>Links to other websites</h3>
            <p>Our Website contains links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that
                we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites or third-parties. We encourage
                you to be aware when you leave our Website and to read the privacy statements of each and every website
                that may collect Personal Information.</p>
            <h3>Information security</h3>
            <p>We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from
                unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical
                safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of
                Personal Information in its control and custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or
                wireless network can be guaranteed. Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you
                acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our
                control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between
                you and our Website cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such information and data may be viewed or
                tampered with in transit by a third-party, despite best efforts.</p>
            <h3>Data breach</h3>
            <p>In the event we become aware that the security of the Website has been compromised or users Personal
                Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including,
                but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate
                measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and
                cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable
                efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the user
                as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do, we will post a notice
                on the Website.</p>
            <h3>Legal disclosure</h3>
            <p>We will disclose any information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law, such as to
                comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is
                necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or
                respond to a government request.</p>
            <h3>Changes and amendments</h3>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in our discretion and will notify you of any material
                changes to the way in which we treat Personal Information. When changes are made, we will revise the
                updated date at the bottom of this page. We may also provide notice to you in other ways in our
                discretion, such as through contact information you have provided. Any updated version of this Privacy
                Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy unless otherwise
                specified. Your continued use of the Website or Services after the effective date of the revised Privacy
                Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those changes.
                However, we will not, without your consent, use your Personal Data in a manner materially different than
                what was stated at the time your Personal Data was collected.</p>
            <h3>Acceptance of this policy</h3>
            <p>You acknowledge that you have read this Policy and agree to all its terms and conditions. By using the
                Website or its Services you agree to be bound by this Policy. If you do not agree to abide by the terms
                of this Policy, you are not authorized to use or access the Website and its Services.</p>
